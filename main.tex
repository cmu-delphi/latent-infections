\begin{abstract}
The true timing and magnitude of COVID-19 infections are of interest to both the public and to public health, but these are
challenging to pin down for a variety of data-driven and methodological reasons.
Accurate estimates of latent COVID-19 infections can improve our understanding
of the size and scope of the pandemic and provide more meaningful and timely
quantification of disease patterns and burden. In this work, we estimate daily
incident \emph{infections} for each \US state. To this end, we first deconvolve reported
COVID-19 cases to their date of infection onset using delay distributions estimated from
the CDC line list. We then use a serology-driven model to scale these deconvolved 
cases to account for the unreported infections. 
Our results cover all states at the daily
frequency, incorporate variant-specific incubation periods, and account for
reinfections and waning antigenic immunity. This analysis also produces
estimates for other important quantities such as the number of deconvolved cases
specific to each variant and the infection-case-report ratio. Finally, we discuss some
implications of our results: a disease burden that appears earlier and more
extensively than previously quantified; differential infection-hospitalization
ratio estimates. Our findings help to better understand the impact of the
pandemic in the \US prior to the onset of Omicron and its descendants.
