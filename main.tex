%The true timing and magnitude of COVID-19 infections are of interest to both the
%public and to public health, but these are challenging to pin down for a variety
%of reasons such as the underdetection of asymptomatic cases and delays in
%reporting. Accurate estimates of latent COVID-19 infections can improve our
%understanding of the size and scope of the pandemic and provide more meaningful
%and timely quantification of disease patterns and burden. In this work, we
%describe methodology to estimate daily incident \emph{infections} for each \US
%state. To this end, we first deconvolve reported COVID-19 cases to their date of
%infection onset using delay distributions estimated from the CDC line list. We
%then use a serology-driven model to scale these deconvolved cases to account for
%the unreported infections. The resulting daily infection estimates
%incorporate variant-specific incubation periods, reinfections,
%and waning antigenic immunity. This analysis also produces estimates for other
%important quantities such as the number of deconvolved cases specific to each
%variant and the infection-case-report ratio (also referred to as the case
%ascertainment ratio). Finally, we discuss some implications of our results: a
%disease burden that appears earlier and more extensively than previously
%quantified and differential infection-hospitalization ratio estimates. Our
%findings help to better understand the progression of the pandemic in the \US
%prior to the onset of Omicron and its descendants.

\begin{abstract}

The timing and magnitude of COVID-19
infections are of interest to the public and to public health, but these are
challenging to discern due to the volume of undetected asymptomatic cases and
reporting delays. Accurate estimates of COVID-19 infections based on finalized data
can improve our understanding of the true size of the pandemic and provide more meaningful
and timely quantification of disease patterns and burden. 
In this work, we retrospectively estimate daily incident infections for
each \US state prior to Omicron. To this end, reported COVID-19 cases are
deconvolved to their date of infection onset using delay distributions estimated
from the CDC line list. Then, a novel serology-driven model is used to scale these 
deconvolved cases to account for
the unreported infections. The resulting
infections incorporate variant-specific incubation periods,
reinfections, and waning antigenic immunity. 
They clearly demonstrate that the disease burden from infections emerges earlier and more extensively than is reflected by cases. Most notably, infections were severely underreported during the Delta wave, with an estimated reporting rate as low as 6.3\% in New Jersey, 7.3\% in Maryland, and 8.4\% in Nevada. 
Moreover, in 44 states, fewer than 30\% of infections were eventually reported as cases during this period.
Therefore, while reported cases offer a convenient proxy of disease burden, they fail to capture the full extent of infections, and often severely underestimate the true disease burden. Finalized infection estimates provide a more realistic picture of the pandemic's progression in the \US prior to the onset of Omicron and its descendants. Furthermore, this retrospective analysis produces estimates for other important quantities for every state such as the number of deconvolved cases specific to each variant, time-varying case ascertainment ratios, and infection-hospitalization ratios.
