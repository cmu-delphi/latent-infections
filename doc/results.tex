\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

By estimating the time series of COVID-19 infections per 100,000 inhabitants
for each \US state from June 1, 2020 to November 29, 2021, we observe rates of
infections that vary in intensity and disease burden across space and time
(Figures \ref{fig:state_infect_est}--\ref{fig:six-states}). Outbreaks in
infections precede those in cases and are consistently larger in magnitude
(we will often take ``cases'' to mean ``reported cases'').

The largest per-capita outbreaks prior to Omicron were observed in the late
summer or early fall of 2021 in Georgia, Louisiana, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming,
matching the intuition of similar viral spread in clusters of geographically
proximate states. During this time, the two states that have the highest rate of
infections on single day are Georgia (451 infections per 100K, on August 15,
2021) and Idaho (also 451 infections per 100K, on September 7, 2021). The period
of lowest viral transmission is observed in the summer of 2020. From June 2020
to the end of August, Vermont saw only about 10 infections per 100K per week,
the longest such lull for any state.



\subsection{Infection estimates reveal waves missed by reported cases.}
\label{sec:omitted-waves}

Relative to reported cases, examining estimated infections reveals a
rather different pattern. \autoref{fig:state_infect_est} shows
estimates of the number of daily new infections per 100,000 inhabitants for each
\US state from June 1, 2020 to November 29, 2021 compared with reported cases,
and deconvolved cases---reported cases ``pushed back'' by the delays shown in
\autoref{fig:chain_events_onset_report}. 

Most states exhibit at least two major spikes in infections---the first starts
in the fall of 2020 and extends into the winter season, while the second starts
in the late summer of 2021 and proceeds into the mid-fall. These represent major
waves driven by the Ancestral and Delta variants, respectively. Similar patterns
of these major surges are observed in nearly all states, though to varying
degrees. In general, greater similarities in the strength and magnitude of
outbreaks are seen to emerge in the clusters of states that border each other.

While the major Ancestral, Alpha, and Delta waves tend to be visible for most
states, there are clear outbreaks in unreported infections that are not easily
detectable from cases alone in the falls of 2020 and 2021. For example, a wave 
of infections is evident in North Dakota and South Dakota over the spring of 2021
that is virtually undetectable from reported cases. For the specific date
of Oct. 20, 2020, \autoref{fig:choro_inf_case_rates} shows increased case
reports in a cluster of Northern-Midwest states like North Dakota, South Dakota,
and Wisconsin relative to the other states. However, the infection rates more clearly
emphasize that this phenomenon is not limited to these states, but extends out
to the surrounding states as well. In the late summer of 2021, the
Delta wave is only faintly detectable from cases in a number of Northeastern
states (New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Hampshire), however,
infections suggest that it has already begun in earnest. It is clear that cases fail to
adequately capture the rise and fall in infections during this time.

\subsection{The cases-to-infections ratio varies by state and variant.}
\label{sec:case-infection-ratio}

population for each \US state from June 1, 2020 to November 29, 2021
(dark blue line). The blue shaded regions depict the 50, 80, and 95\%
confidence intervals for the estimates, while the teal line represents
the number of new daily new deconvolved cases per 100,000, and the
orange line represents the trailing 7-day average of reported cases per
100,000.}
\label{fig:state_infect_est}
\end{figure}    

While it is clear from \autoref{fig:state_infect_est} that cases underestimate
the true burden of infections for every state, the degree to which this problem
persists varies across states and variants. For the Delta wave, some of the
largest discrepancies between cases and infections are visible in the Western
states of Idaho and Montana, the Southern states of Louisiana and Georgia, and
the Midwestern states of Iowa and Nebraska. For the Ancestral wave, the largest
discrepancies are more frequently in the Midwest: states such as Illinois,
Indiana, and Ohio. Early in the pandemic, such discrepancies between cases and
infections may be attributable to state-specific issues with the reporting
pipeline, while later, they more likely due to the rise in asymptomatic
infections across variants \citep{oph2022covid, garrett2022high}. 

The ratio between cases and infections decreases with time. While the Delta wave
is somewhat apparent from the case counts for all states
(\autoref{fig:state_infect_est}), infection estimates suggest that case counts
severely underestimate infections during this time for many states, more so than
in earlier waves. The most extreme was New Jersey, where about 4.6\% of
estimated infections were eventually reported as cases. Similarly low are
Maryland (7.4\%), Connecticut (8.0\%), and Florida (8.7\%). This issue extends
to most states: in 39 states fewer than 30\% of infections eventually appear in
case reports. This ratio was less extreme in earlier waves, and its effects most
apparent in different regions. During Alpha, Louisiana had the lowest ratio of
infections to cases (11.7\%) followed by California (14.4\%). Such patterns are
even less apparent during the Ancestral wave, where Ohio and Maryland had the
lowest ratio of reported cases to infections at 22.0\% and 22.3\%,
respectively. 

\autoref{fig:choro_inf_case_rates} shows that on June 1, 2020, there is little
difference between case and infection rates across the states, while later on,
the differences become more pronounced. For example, on July 20, 2021, while the
map of case rates shows low and geographically consistent spread, infection
rates reveal that Texas, Louisiana, Georgia, and their neighbors are hotspots at
that time. Generally, the spatial extent of infections is understated by
cases. For example, on October 20, 2020, while case rates are elevated in a
handful of upper-Midwestern states (namely, North and South Dakota), infection
estimates are similarly elevated in all of the surrounding states, emphisizing a
wider impact.

By focusing on states with elevated cases, infection outbreaks may be
overlooked. For instance, on August 27, 2021, Montana and Idaho have some of the
highest infection rates. In contrast, the case rates are unremarkable for these
two states, whereas the highest rates tend to be localized to the Southeastern
states. However, the opposite occurs as well: on December
17, 2020, Tennessee and California have the highest case rates but minimal
infections relative to other states.

November 29, 2021. Note that the first date was chosen as a baseline, while the
other dates were chosen due because they show large counts of infections across all
states. In particular, the third and fifth dates present the largest number of
total infections across the 50 states within those calendar years.}

\subsection{Infections, overall and by variant, emphasize earlier outbreaks.}
\label{sec:infections-by-voc}

\autoref{fig:six-states} examines the infection estimates for a selection of
states more closely. The top panel shows infection estimates for these states,
while the bottom panel disaggregates their deconvolved cases based on the locally
circulating variant proportions at the time. These figures show times when the
total infections and the deconvolved cases by variant emphasize earlier
outbreaks than are indicated by cases alone. For example, the Ancestral
wave in California, Maryland, Idaho, Montana, and Ohio peaks earlier for
infections than cases. Such trends are similar with Delta, though more obviously
in Louisiana, Idaho and Montana than California, Maryland and Ohio. The division
by variant categories reveals the variant(s) that are behind these waves. For
example, we can see a major increase in Alpha in Massachusetts over the spring
of 2021. To a lesser extent, this trend is also apparent for the other states,
save for California, where Alpha is not a major driver of infections in
comparison to the other variants in circulation around that time: in California,
the spike in Epsilon circulation occurs alongside the Ancestral wave.

\subsection{The relationship between infections and hospitalizations is messy.}
\label{sec:lagged-correlations}

We systematically investigate the temporal relationship between infections and
hospitalizations with Spearman's rank-correlation across different lags,
shifting hospitalizations backward to align with infections
(\autoref{fig:correlations}). The maximum average correlation across states is
0.51, occurring at a lag of 13 days. In contrast, we find that the greatest
average Spearman correlation for cases is 0.69 and occurs at a lag of 1 day.
That is, case reports are nearly contemporaneous to hospitalizations, while
infection estimates clearly precede them. The maximum correlation at a lag of 13
days is in keeping with estimates of the average time from infection to
hospitalization for cases reported in January, 2020 in Wuhan, China (9.7 days)
as well as with estimates from across the pandemic in the UK (ranging from 8.0
to 9.7 days) \citep{ward2021understanding}. Importantly, the 13 day lag in the
\US\ also includes the impact of the reporting pipeline, a delay omitted from
the international estimates. 

\begin{figure}[!tb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.5\linewidth]{corr-plot-1.pdf} 
\caption{Spearman's correlation between each of cases, deconvolved cases, and
infections with hospitalizations per 100,000. These are calculated for each lag,
state and rolling window of 61 days before averaging. The vertical dashed lines
indicate the lags for which the highest average correlation is attained.}
\label{fig:correlations}
\end{figure}
    

While both the infections and deconvolved cases are leading indicators of
hospitalizations and their trajectories are similar, the average correlation
they attain is different. In particular, the correlation is larger for
deconvolved cases than for infections (with a difference of about 0.18 at the
peaks). This increase is likely due to two issues. First, many cases are
detected contemporaneously with hospitalization: people may first test
positive only when they go to to the hospital for treatment. Second, unreported
infections tend to be less severe and less likely to lead to hospitalization
than those that are reported \citep{sallahi2021using}.



\subsection{Infection-hospitalization ratios are smaller and more stable.}
\label{sec:ihrs}

As a counterpart to the correlation analysis, we compute the time-varying
infection-hospitalization ratios (IHRs) for each state using the correlation
maximizing lag. We similarly compute the case-hospitalization ratios (CHRs)
using their correlation maximizing lag for comparison
(\autoref{fig:IHR_7dav}). 

\begin{figure}[!tb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{ihrs-1.pdf}
\caption{Time-varying IHR and CHR estimates for each state from June 1, 2020
to November 29, 2021, obtained using the corresponding optimal lag from the
systematic lag analysis. Note that the infection, case, and hospitalization
counts are subject to a center-aligned 7-day average to remove spurious day
of the week effects. Also note that the different starting points across
states are due to the availability of the hospitalization data.}
\label{fig:IHR_7dav}
\end{figure}
    

For each state, the CHRs tend to be larger and noiser relative to IHRs. This
supports our claim that reported infections are more likely to require
hospitalization than unreported infections. Both IHRs and CHRs exhibit similar
geospatial and temporal trends as those noted for infections above. Namely,
states that are proximate (for example, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia) tend
to exhibit similar temporal patterns in IHRs and CHRs. In addition, similar
spikes are evident across many states during waves of infections that are driven
by variants of concern. For example, some states exhibit a striking increase in
hospitalizations in mid-2021, which coincides with the rapid takeover of the
Delta variant \citep{hodcroft2021covariants}. This finding aligns with previous
studies that found an increased risk in hospitalization due to Delta
\citep{twohig2022hospital, nyberg2022comparative}. Interestingly, when the
Ancestral variant predominates in 2020, there is a spike in the IHRs that rivals
or even surpasses that which is observed in the time of Delta. This situation is
most easily observed in New York, New Jersey, Vermont, and New Hampshire as well
as in some Western states such as Arizona, New Mexico, and Wyoming.

Overall, the relationship between infections and hospitalizations is
complicated. We observe intermittent spikes that punctuate longer periods where
the IHRs are relatively stabile, remaining below 0.1 hospitalizations per
infection. While we computed and compared CHRs and IHRs for all states, it is
important to note that both likely vary within states and depend on confounding
variables such as age and the presence of major comorbidities
\citep{russell2023comorbidities}. Therefore, it would be beneficial to account
for such variables in their calculations by, for example, stratifying infections
and hospitalizations by age to produce age-specific estimates of the IHRs for
each state~\citep{fox2023disproportionate}.
