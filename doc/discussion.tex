\section{Discussion}

We retrospectively estimated daily incident infections for each \US state over
the period June 1, 2020 to November 29, 2021. Our estimates suggest, confirming
the intuition, that the pandemic impacted states earlier and at a larger scale
than is indicated by reported cases. They also emphasize that using cases as a
proxy for infections can lead to erroneous conclusions about trends in infections.
More importantly, we observe outbreaks in infections that are missed from
inspecting cases alone such as the Delta wave in 
New Jersey, Connecticut, and Maryland.
These sorts of omissions serve to emphasize that cases paint an incomplete
picture of the pandemic, especially when outbreaks are largely driven by
unreported infections. Furthermore, since case reports generally follow symptom
and infection onsets, cases have a built-in temporal bias. This bias is in addition
to other biases from differences in reporting across states such as temporary
bottlenecks due influxes of data or more persistent processing issues that
increase the average time from case detection to report \citep{wash2020dash,
dunkel2020covid19}. Thus, while reported cases provide an indication of the
trajectory of the pandemic, it is delayed and incomplete.

Our approach offers a number of advantages. By incorporating state-level case,
line list, and variant circulation data, we are able to construct incubation and
delay distributions that are state- and time- specific. Time-varying and
state-specific seroprevalence data allows the reporting ratio estimates to
similarly vary over space and time, a departure from existing work
\citep{unwin2020state, uga2020covid19}. Unlike previous approaches that use a
single delay distribution to generate estimates for all states
\citep{chitwood2022reconstructing, jahja2022real, miller2022statistical}, our work avoids this
assumption of geographic invariance, an assumption that is far from realistic
due to differences in the reporting pipelines, pandemic response, and variants in
circulation, among other things. Similarly, prior methodology relies on only one incubation
period distribution \citep{miller2022statistical}, 
whereas our method incorporates variant-specific incubation periods.
This enhances our infection onset estimation by accounting for
the differences across variants--specifically, 
that newer variants tend to have shorter incubation periods
\citep{tanaka2022shorter, ogata2022shorter, wu2022incubation}.

Another limitation of previous approaches to estimate infections is that they
often fail to account for reinfections. While reinfections constitute a small
portion of the total infections until the arrival of high immune-escape variants
(BA.1), disregarding them means that the infection-reporting ratio will tend to
be underestimated with seroprevalence data alone. By accounting for reinfections
as well as the waning of seropositivity (\Cref{sec:report-ratio}), we more
accurately estimate this ratio. However, future work could refine this analysis.
Because the waning of immunity is likely to be variant-dependent
\citep{pooley2023durability}, our model's single waning parameter would be more
accurately estimated as a mixture of variant-specific parameters with weights
determined by the proportion of the variants circulating. 
%Relatedly, newer variants may escape detection
%\citep{nih2022assessing, fda2023sars}. While in a retrospective analysis, where
%finalized data is used, this is less likely to be an issue, detection escape
%would pose a problem for real-time estimates of infections.

We chose to end our analysis on November 29, 2021, for two main reasons. The
first is that Omicron and subsequent variants come with substantial increases in
the risk of reinfection in comparison to previous variants, likely due to
increased immune escape \citep{wei2024risk, pulliam2022increased,
eythorsson2022rate}. Access to reinfection data that is representative of each
location under study is paramount for extending the analysis. While it would be
ideal to use the reinfection rates over time for each \US state, many states do
not publicly report reinfection data over the entire time period under
examination, if at all.
% While it would be ideal to use confirmed rates over time for each \US state,
% most states do not publicly report reinfection data over the entire time period
% we considered. So we have turned to suspected reinfection data over time for
% Clark County, USA, as that surveillance is among the most detailed and reputable
% that we have found for the United States. Nevertheless, using such localized
% data raises questions of representativeness and the applicability of such
% estimates to Nevada and all other states. Furthermore, this data has no
% information available beyond suspected third infections, which imposes an
% irremediable bias. However, based on the third infection data available there,
% we expect that the probability of being reinfected more than three times is
% likely very low for time frame considered and so the omission of these would
% impact our infection estimates to a minimal extent. 
%
% The vast majority of issues we encountered when trying to reconstruct the
% infection time series for each state are due to an absence or a lack of data.
% Such is the primary issue we had with the restricted line list. In comparison to
% the number of JHU cases (which we are treating as a gold standard) for the same
% release date, we noted there are about $10$ million cases that are unaccounted
% for in the CDC line list. Moreover, the missingness does not appear to be random
% and uniformly distributed across states. Rather it is unequally distributed,
% suggesting that the dataset is likely biased. However, more information on the
% cases that are missing versus present would be required to determine the extent
% the missing cases led to a nonrepresentative, and therefore, biased sample, and
% could be a topic of further study.
The second reason is that the case-ascertainment ratio after December 2021 can
no longer be estimated with seroprevalence data alone. Specifically, while most
state-level data suggests that reinfections still account for less than 20\% of
reported cases during Omicron \citep{ruff2022rapid, nyreinfect2021,
hireinfect2022, wareinfect2022}, seropositivity rapidly reaches nearly 100\% of
the population. Therefore, alternative data sources for estimating the
case-ascertainment ratio must be considered. For example, wastewater
surveillance data may be complementary to seroprevalence data, especially when
testing is low, or serve as a substitute when it is unavailable
\citep{mcmanus2023predicting}. In follow-up work, we extend our
construction of daily incident infections for the states where sufficient data
is available to track reinfections and to incorporate wastewater data.
% However, viral detection is inconsistent across
% locations due to temperature, per-capita water use, and in-sewer travel time
% \citep{mcmanus2023predicting, hart2020computational, li2023correlation}.
An alternative approach could use surveillance streams such as those from
surveys, helplines, or medical records could potentially be integrated if they
offer a sufficiently strong signal of the disease intensity over time
\citep{reinhart2021open,ecdc2020strategies}.



% \attn{Some into Methods, some into Supplement}
% also runs the risk of being nonrepresentative of the
% intended population \citep{bajema2021estimated}. For example, in the blood donor
% dataset some states have region specific-estimates, which clearly do not stand
% for the entire state. Another source of systematic variation is in the
% characteristics of the individuals who opt for blood tests versus those who do
% not. For instance, there may be a healthy user bias, in which a number of those
% who opt for blood tests are generally more inclined to partake in proactive
% healthy behaviors (such as checking on basic health markers by taking an annual
% blood test) than those who do not \citep{parsley2018blood}. Alternatively, a
% number of individuals may be recommended for blood tests by their doctors due to
% signs of ill-health (ex. mineral deficiencies or underlying medical conditions).
% The extent that each such bias persists depends on the purpose of the blood test
% and whether it was used as a proactive or reactive medical tool. Since such
% information is unavailable to us, all we can conclude is that participant-driven
% sources of bias impact the seroprevalence samples to an undetermined extent.
% There are additional concerns about the performance of antibody testing for
% individuals with mild or asymptomatic disease as well as about the loss of
% immunity over time \citep{kaku2021performance, seow2020longitudinal,
% ibarrondo2020rapid}.
% 
% In this work, we do not attempt to directly address infection underascertainment
% due to the increase in asymptomatic infections across variants
% \citep{pho2023covid19}. We simply note that this would likely pose a greater
% problem later in the pandemic, particularly after the Delta era
% \citep{fan2022sars}. We hope that such infections would be largely represented
% by the seroprevalence and reinfection estimates, but there is undoubtedly
% increasing reliance on such estimates to be able to do this over time (owing to
% the simultaneous decline in the reporting cadence and the apparent rise in
% asymptomatic infections over time) \citep{oph2022covid, garrett2022high,
% blauer2022reduce, ren2021asymptomatic}. Consequently, there is an increasing
% uncertainty over time that is not captured by the model or the estimates.   


Our work develops a deconvolution-based approach to inferring infection onset,
combining available line list data with variant circulation estimates and
literature derived incubation periods. The result removes the effects of the
delay from reported cases, pushing them back to infection onset. This approach
process is complemented with the development of a model that leverages the
measurements of waning detectable antibody levels and seroprevalence surveys.
The resulting infection estimates as well as their geospatial and temporal
trends are strongly grounded in both data and statistical models.
%
% Our approach is predicated upon having case, line list, viral circulation, and
% seroprevalence data for each state, all of which are readily available (or
% available upon request in the case of restricted line list data). As a result of
% this, we are able to demonstrate the feasibility of estimating COVID-19
% infections at the state level by using standard sources of data. 
%
% Our framework is quite versatile as it lends itself to more localized, county or
% community level estimates, or globalized, country-specific estimates.
% Fundamentally, to produce estimates of infections for different geographic
% regions, one would simply need to input the required data and re-run the code
% pipeline. In this way, one could readily adapt our approach to generate
% estimates for the provinces in Canada or the regions in England.
%
These well-informed, localized estimates of COVID-19 infections over time
provide a clearer and more comprehensive understanding of the course of the
pandemic. Such estimates contribute important information on the timing and
magnitude of the disease burden for each location, and they highlight trends
that may not be visible from reported case data alone. Therefore, our infection
estimates provide key information for the ongoing investigation on the true size
and impact of the pandemic.
