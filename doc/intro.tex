\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Reported COVID-19 cases are a staple in tracking the pandemic at varying
geographic resolutions \citep{dong2020interactive, nyt2020corona,
wp2020tracking}. Yet, for every case that is eventually reported to public
health, several infections are likely to have occurred, and likely much earlier. To
see why, it is important to understand \emph{whose} cases are being reported and
what differentiates them from unreported cases as well as \emph{when} these
case reports happen. \Cref{fig:chain_events_onset_report} shows an
illustration of the path of a symptomatic infection that is eventually
reported to public health. Using this figure, we can discern a number of sources
of bias in the reporting pipeline. For instance, diagnostic testing mainly
targets symptomatic individuals; thus, infected individuals exhibiting little to
no symptoms are omitted \citep{cdc2022estimated}. In addition, testing
practices, availability, and uptake vary temporally and spatially
\citep{pitzer2021impact, ecdc2020strategies, hitchings2021usefulness}. Finally,
cases provide a belated view of the pandemic's progression, because they are
subject to delays due to the viral incubation period, the speed and severity of
symptom onset, laboratory confirmation, test turnaround times, and eventual
submission to public health \citep{pellis2021challenges, wash2020dash}. For
these reasons, reported cases are a lagging indicator of the course of the
pandemic. Furthermore, they do not represent the actual number of new infections
that occur on a given day based on exposure to the pathogen. Since there
was no large-scale surveillance effort in the United States that reliably
tracked symptom onset, let alone infection onset, ascertaining the onset of all
\emph{infections} is challenging.

Contextualizing the course of the pandemic, understanding the effects of
interventions, and drawing insights for future pandemics is challenging because
the spatial and temporal behaviour of infections is unknown. While reported
cases provide a convenient proxy of the disease burden in a population, it is
incomplete, delayed, and misrepresents the true size and timing of the pandemic.
Regardless of these difficulties, it is important to the public and public
health to perform a pandemic post-mortem. Estimates of daily incident infections
are one such way to measure this and can guide understanding of the pandemic
burden over space and time.

    reported cases to incident infection estimates. In Step 1, we use the CDC
    line list data to deconvolve reported cases (grey) backward to the date of
    positive specimen (red). Step 2 separately deconvolves these to the date of
    infection by variant (Epsilon in Purple, Ancestral in Green), 
    before summing across all variants (orange)
    in Step 3. Finally, we use seroprevalence
    survey and time-varying reinfection data to account for the unreported
    infections.}

In this work, we provide a data-driven reconstruction of daily incident
infections for each \US state from June 1, 2020 to November 29, 2021. Using
state-level line list data, we construct time-varying delay distributions for
the time from symptom onset to positive specimen date and positive specimen to
case report date. We combine these with variant-specific incubation period
distributions to deconvolve daily reported COVID-19 cases back to their
infection onset, removing the effect of the delay. Finally, we adjust for the
unreported infections by using seroprevalence and reinfection data to account
for the waning of antigenic immunity over time. A graphical depiction of our
procedure is shown in \Cref{fig:cases_to_infect_flowchart} with methodological
details deferred to \Cref{sec:methods}. We then examine some features of our
infection estimates and the implications of using them rather than reported
cases in assessing the impact of the pandemic. To this end, we produce simple
time-varying infection-hospitalization ratios (IHRs) for each state and compare
those to similarly derived case-hospitalization ratios (CHRs). While these
analyses provide a glimpse into the utility of our infection estimates, we
believe that there is much more to be explored, and we hope that our work and
publicly-available estimates will prove an important benchmark for others to
undertake retrospective analyses. These estimates, as well as the R and Python
code used to produce them, are available on
